## Background

Choiredex allows retailers to orchestrate their omnichannel customer journeys from their online channels to their stores. Store teams and online customers can now engage together in journeys on which retailers have control. By increasing the number of scheduled store visits and qualified customers, Choiredex allows retailers to distribute better and shorten every interaction between a customer and an associate. Omnichannel customers living a scored retail experience obtain the services and the products they need effortlessly. They are more satisfied and are more likely to purchase and repurchase. With Choiredex, customers and store teams coordinate their activities from the same choral retail score sheet.

* Lazy loading and SVG stroke-dashoffset animation triggers and animation on landing page with the [Intersection Observer API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intersection-observer) and [react-spring](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spring).
